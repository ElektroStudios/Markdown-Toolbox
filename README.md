# Markdown ToolBox

### Multiple Markdown web services confined in a single desktop application.

------------------

## üëã Introduction

I was tired of having to keep multiple tabs open in the web browser to perform occasional operations with Markdown files, so I decided to develop this application to confine the best web services in a simple user interface, and without depending on the system web browser.

The web services to which this desktop application provides direct access are:

 - [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#): The best online markdown editor out there.

 - [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/#converter): Quickly and easily converts Markdown to HTML.

 - [HTML to Markdown Converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/html-to-markdown): Efficiently converts HTML to Markdown.

 - [Markdown Table Converter](https://markdown-convert.com/en/tool/table): Facilitates the conversion of tables from various formats to Markdown.

 - [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/): A comprehensive guide to Markdown syntax.

 - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Because why not?, ChatGPT can help you improve your Markdown document, give you ideas, etc.
